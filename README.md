MFE1
==========================================================================
MFE1 is a Fortran 90 implementation of the gradient-weighted moving finite
element (GWMFE) method for time-dependent PDEs in one space dimension. It
was developed in the mid-1990's as a "modern" successor to the Fortran 77
[GWMFE1DS](https://github.com/mfeproject/legacy-gwmfe) code.

This code was not previously released publicly.
